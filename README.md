See the blakeyjohnr Drive [Mega Reference](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1b2SKNd9ybEGn2DuDn-iYVoeN1MsPpc7RKLkSHoVi8uc/edit) for information on the current setup.

## Conventions

* Use the `/opt` directory for optional software added by me (e.g., I moved duckdns directory and related script here)
* Use the `<this_github_repo>/bin` directory to hold scripts to be executed anywhere (added to `$PATH` in `~/.bashrc`)
* Any directories manually added to `/home/rocks` directory will be lowercase
